# June 1st: Start of the project!

- I chose the MCU for the keyboard. nice!nano v2. and I will use TCA9555DBR I^2C GPIO expansion board to get more pins.


- I will use 6*15 matrix. It is not the best layout but it makes matrix more clear and easy to design.

Completed schematic of key matrix

- battery will be added to the design.

- and I finished case design on onshape. I'm going to use heatset insert for tray mount.
